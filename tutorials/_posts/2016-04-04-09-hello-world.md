In this tutorial, we will create our first window in `engo`.

> #### Recap
> Remember what we did in the last tutorial?
> We created the directory `$GOPATH/github.com/EngoEngine/TrafficManager` - and will be working from this directory
> from now on. All `go`-commands will be executed from this working directory. You will probably be
> working from some similar directory. 

### Our first file
As with all Go-projects, we usually have one main file, and a few other packages we're using. We shall create that
single main file in this tutorial. We shall call it `traffic.go`, but you may give it any other name you want. 

> #### Ensure you can build
> Before continuing, you might want to make sure you can compile and run the most basic Go program there is: hello 
> world:
>
> {% highlight go %}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello!")
}
{% endhighlight %}


There is one function in `engo` that will allow you to start your game / window: `engo.Run(RunOptions, Scene)`. As you
see, there are two parameters to this function: one of type `RunOptions`, where you can set things like `Fullscreen`, 
`FPSLimit`, `VSync`, and much more, and the second one is your default `Scene`. 

> #### Scenes
> Scenes are the barebone of `engo`: they contain pretty much all other things within the game. You should have multiple
> scenes and switch between them: i.e. one for the main menu, another for the loading screen, and yet another for the
> ingame experience. Specifically, a `Scene` contains **one** `World`, a collection of multiple `System`s and a 
> magnitude of `Entity`s - we will be creating those in the next tutorial.  

The easiest way to output "Hello World" within `engo`, is by having this `traffic.go` file:

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
	"engo.io/engo"
	"engo.io/ecs"
)

type myGame struct {}

// Type uniquely defines your game type
func (*myGame) Type() string { return "myGame" }

// Preload is called before loading any assets from the disk, 
// to allow you to register / queue them
func (*myGame) Preload() {}

// Setup is called before the main loop starts. It allows you
// to add entities and systems to your Scene.
func (*myGame) Setup(*ecs.World) {}

// Show is called whenever the other Scene becomes inactive, 
// and this one becomes the active one
func (*myGame) Show() {}

// Hide is called when an other Scene becomes active
func (*myGame) Hide() {}

func main() {
	opts := engo.RunOptions{
		Title: "Hello World",
		Width:  400,
		Height: 400,
	}
	engo.Run(opts, &myGame{})
}
{% endhighlight %}

Currently, this `Scene` does nothing. But it will compile and run. It'll open up a window, with the title "Hello World".

### Preparing our first Texture
We want to render something onto the screen at this point. For this, we want to create a new directory within our
`TrafficManager` directory, called `assets` (you can also name it `res`, or any name you like). In here, we shall be
putting all resource-files, such as textures, audio files, etc. Let's create a subfolder `textures`. The full path would
be: `$GOPATH/github.com/EngoEngine/TrafficManager/assets/textures`. 

The texture we would like to draw onto the screen, is going to be an illustration of the "Location"-icon we all know. 

<figure class="callout text-center">
<a href="/img/tutorials/01/city.png" target="_blank">
<img alt="City texture" src="/img/tutorials/01/city.png" style="height:200px">
<figcaption>The *City* icon, <strong>city.png</strong></figcaption>
</a>
</figure>

We shall save this file within the `assets/textures` directory. 

### Loading the texture into the game
We have to load the actual file from the disk. Fortunately, `engo` has helper-functions available within
`engo.Files`. It has an `Add` function, which allows us to specify the location of one or more files, and they
automatically get loaded once the `Preload()` function returns. 

Applying this, we get:

{% highlight go %}
// Preload is called before loading any assets from the disk, 
// to allow you to register / queue them
func (*myGame) Preload() {
	engo.Files.Add("assets/textures/city.png")
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Rendering the *City* icon
Rendering something consists of three things:

* The System (`RenderSystem`, specifically);
* The Entity (you can have a lot of these);
* Two Components (`RenderComponent` and `SpaceComponent`).

#### Adding the System
In order to add the `RenderSystem` to our `engo`-game, we want to add it within the `Setup` function of our `Scene`. 

{% highlight go %}
// Setup is called before the main loop starts. It allows you 
// to add entities and systems to your Scene.
func (*myGame) Setup(world *ecs.World) {
	world.AddSystem(&engo.RenderSystem{})
}
{% endhighlight %}

More speficially, an instance of the `RenderSystem` is added to the `World` of this specific `Scene`. 

> ##### Do you recall?
> Each `Scene` has only **one** `World`. And this `World` is a collection of systems and entities. 

#### Adding the Entity
After we've added the `RenderSystem` to the `World`, we are now ready to create our `Entity` and add it as well. `ECS`
has a helper function called `ecs.NewEntity([]string{...})`, which allows you to easily create new entities. It 
requires one argument: a list of names of `System`s you want to associate it with. Basically, it says: this `System` is
allowed to (and usually supposed to) read/write my values. 

> ##### NewEntity
> Creating the Entity is as simple as:
> {% highlight go %}
entity := ecs.NewEntity([]string{"RenderSystem"})
{% endhighlight %}

Now for the `Component`s: every `Entity` has them. They are the only way of giving value / meaning to entities. We
mentioned two required `Component`s: the `RenderComponent`, which holds information about what to render (i.e. the 
texture), and the `SpaceComponent`, which holds information about where the `Entity` is located (and thus *where*
it should be rendered). We can simply initialize these and add them to the newly created `Entity`. 

> ##### SpaceComponent
> This will locate the `Entity` at 10 units lower and to the right, from the origin. It will be 303 units wide, and
> 641 units high. 
>
> {% highlight go %}
entity.AddComponent(&engo.SpaceComponent{
    Position: engo.Point{10, 10},
    Width:    303,
    Height:   641,
})
{% endhighlight %}

The `RenderComponent` is a bit tricky though, as it requires us to define which `Texture` to draw. The helper-function
`engo.NewRenderComponent(texture Drawable, scale engo.Point, label string)` requires you to define that `Texture`,
give a `Scale` (usually just `engo.Point{1, 1}`), and a label (any string you'd like, unused for the moment). 

Luckily, we added the `Texture` during the `Preload()` function, so we can easily access it using 
`engo.Files.Image(...)`. 

> ##### RenderComponent
> 
> {% highlight go %}
texture := engo.Files.Image("city.png")
entity.AddComponent(engo.NewRenderComponent(
    texture, 
    engo.Point{1, 1}, 
    "city texture",
))
{% endhighlight %}

Now we've completed the `Entity`, we should not forget to use it:

> ##### Adding the `Entity` to the `World`
> 
> {% highlight go %}
world.AddEntity(entity)
{% endhighlight %}

If we were to run our game (`go run traffic.go`), the result should look something like this:

<figure class="callout text-center">
<a href="/img/tutorials/01/black.png" target="_blank">
<img alt="City texture" src="/img/tutorials/01/black.png" style="height:200px">
<figcaption>Our game so far, with the (default) black background</strong></figcaption>
</a>
</figure>

### Making improvements
As you might have noticed, a black background doesn't fit in nicely with our non-transparent white background at the
*City* icon. We might change the white to transparent, but that won't improve that much. Let's change the background
to white instead:

> ##### Changing the background color
>
> You can change the background color with this line of code:
>
> {% highlight go %}
engo.SetBackground(color.White)
{% endhighlight %}
>
> Note that we're using `color`, so be sure to import `image/color`. It's in the standard library. This line of code
> should go somewhere within the `Setup` function, and preferably at the top. However, it's not mandatory to put it 
> *there*, and you can dynamically change the background color as you please. 

It our game looks like this:
